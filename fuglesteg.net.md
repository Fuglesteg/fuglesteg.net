After learning and using Go for about a year I grew tired of it's insane productivity.
This might sound odd, why would anyone get tired of a productive language? Yet I did.
Go is an amazing language for getting stuff done, but I was getting annoyed by it's rigid design.
I wanted change. And as is often the case when leaving a loved one, I went for something completely opposite.

For the last year or so I have been delving deep into the Lisp family of languages.
